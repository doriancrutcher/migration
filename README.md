# Sentry Self-Hosted → SaaS Migration Toolkit

**This README is the master runbook.** The migration is performed by running the tools below **one at a
time, in the order given** — there is deliberately **no single orchestrator script**. Each tool does one
data type, is `--dry-run`-first, and writes its own results file that you review **before** running the next
one. Do not skip ahead: later steps depend on files written by earlier ones, and the manual review between
steps is the safety checkpoint against destructive writes (see [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) D8).

Fork of [github.com/dgbailey/migration](https://github.com/dgbailey/migration), reorganized into per-tool
folders.

- **Roadmap, milestones, branch model:** [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- **Changelog (vs. upstream):** [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
- **Scope decisions log (deferrals to revisit):** [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)
- **Data sources (export vs. live API) + producing the export:** [SOURCING.md](SOURCING.md)

## How the data flows

Two sources feed the migration:

- **Export-driven** (core + pre-flight): a self-hosted relocation export (Django `dumpdata`-style JSON —
  a flat list of `{"model", "pk", "fields"}` objects) is parsed and recreated in SaaS.
- **Live-API-driven** (settings tools): things the export doesn't carry are read from the live self-hosted
  REST API (read-only) via [`common/selfhosted_source.py`](common/selfhosted_source.py) and written to SaaS.

```
self-hosted --(export)-->  export.json  --.
                                           >--(tools + SaaS token)--> sentry.io
self-hosted --(read API)-> live settings -'
```

The two sources are used in **separate steps and never mixed**: pre-flight (Step 1) and core (Step 3) are
100% export-driven and never touch the live self-hosted API; settings (Step 4) are 100% live-API-driven and
never read the export. See [SOURCING.md](SOURCING.md) for a step-by-step breakdown of which step uses which
source, and for how to produce the export on managed/dedicated hosting.

## Set these once (referenced by every command below)

```bash
export SAAS_TOKEN=...          # SaaS internal-integration token
export SH_TOKEN=...            # self-hosted read token (settings steps only)
export DEST_ORG=my-saas-org    # destination SaaS org slug
export SRC_ORG=migration-test-org                        # self-hosted source org slug
export SRC_URL=https://sentry.your-instance.example/api/0   # live self-hosted API base (settings steps)
export EXPORT=export.json       # path to the export for the org currently being migrated
```

Tokens: create the **SaaS token** as an Internal Integration (Org Settings → Developer Settings → Custom
Integrations) with scopes `org:write team:write project:admin member:write alerts:write` (member invites also
require a plan with the invite feature enabled). Create the **self-hosted read token** (`org:read`,
`project:read`) on the self-hosted instance itself. No credentials are ever committed or shipped.

### Works with any self-hosted hosting (dedicated host, VM, or local Docker)

The tools don't care how the self-hosted instance is hosted — only two touch points vary, both via flags:

- **How you produce the export (Step 0)** depends on your access to the instance (see the three variants below).
- **The settings steps read the live self-hosted API** at `--source-url "$SRC_URL"` (default is local
  `http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/0`). They need network reachability to that URL (directly or via VPN, valid TLS)
  and the `SH_TOKEN` minted on that instance. The pre-flight and core steps need only the export file.

## Order of operations (run each step, review, then continue)

Run every command from this directory. **Dry-run first** (append `--dry-run`), inspect the output, then
re-run the same command without `--dry-run`. After each step, review the results file it writes before moving
on. Each folder's own `README.md` has the full per-flag detail.

### Step 0 — Produce the self-hosted export (one JSON per source org)

Use whichever matches your access; all three produce the same relocation JSON:

```bash
# a) shell/CLI on the self-hosted host
sentry export organizations export.json --filter-org-slugs "$SRC_ORG" --no-prompt

# b) local Docker Compose (mount a host dir so the file lands outside the container)
docker compose run --rm -T -v "$PWD:/export" \
  web export organizations /export/export.json --filter-org-slugs "$SRC_ORG" --no-prompt

# c) managed/dedicated hosting: have the provider/admin run the relocation export and hand you the JSON
#    (see SOURCING.md for exactly what the provider needs to run and how to receive the file)
```

For a multi-org merge, run Step 0 once per source org (`--filter-org-slugs <slug>`) to get `org1.json`,
`org2.json`, …

### Step 1 — Pre-flight duplicates report (multi-org merges only)

Offline and read-only; never writes to SaaS. Resolve every **Danger** collision (rename/merge/drop) before
migrating anything.

```bash
python3 preflight/duplicates_report.py org1.json org2.json org3.json --html
# review duplicate_report.html / duplicate_report.json
```

### Step 2 — Destination prerequisites (before any write)

Install the one dependency (`requests`) used by the core and settings tools (`preflight/` needs nothing):

```bash
pip install "requests>=2.31.0"
```

Then, in SaaS: confirm the destination org exists, and create a **team whose slug is exactly `migration`**
(every project is created under it in Step 3a). Make sure `SAAS_TOKEN`, `SH_TOKEN`, `DEST_ORG`, `SRC_ORG`, and
`SRC_URL` are exported (above).

### Step 3 — Core content (projects → teams → members → membership → alerts)

Order is fixed by mapping-file dependencies. Dry-run each first.

```bash
# 3a. Projects  -> project_management_results.json
python3 core/create_sentry_projects.py "$SAAS_TOKEN" "$DEST_ORG" "$EXPORT"

# 3b. Teams (+ attach to projects)  -> project_team_sync_results.json
python3 core/create_sentry_teams.py "$SAAS_TOKEN" "$DEST_ORG" "$EXPORT"

# 3c. Members  -> user_mappings_for_teams.json, member_id_mappings.json
python3 core/add_sentry_members.py "$SAAS_TOKEN" "$DEST_ORG" --export-file "$EXPORT"

# 3d. Team membership  -> team_member_assignments.json
python3 core/assign_team_members.py "$SAAS_TOKEN" "$DEST_ORG" "$EXPORT" user_mappings_for_teams.json

# 3e. Alerts (metric + issue)  -> alert_rule_migration_results_<ts>.json
python3 core/migrate_alert_rules.py "$SAAS_TOKEN" "$DEST_ORG" "$EXPORT" project_team_sync_results.json
```

### Step 4 — Settings (live-API sourced; `--source-url` points at the self-hosted instance)

```bash
# 4a. Org governance + privacy  -> org_settings_migration_results.json
python3 org-settings/migrate_org_settings.py "$SAAS_TOKEN" "$DEST_ORG" \
  --source-token "$SH_TOKEN" --source-org "$SRC_ORG" --source-url "$SRC_URL"

# 4b. Per-project general settings  -> project_settings_migration_results.json
python3 project-settings/migrate_project_settings.py "$SAAS_TOKEN" "$DEST_ORG" \
  --source-token "$SH_TOKEN" --source-org "$SRC_ORG" --source-url "$SRC_URL"

# 4c. Data scrubbers (org + project)  -> data_scrubbers_migration_results.json
python3 data-scrubbers/migrate_data_scrubbers.py "$SAAS_TOKEN" "$DEST_ORG" \
  --source-token "$SH_TOKEN" --source-org "$SRC_ORG" --source-url "$SRC_URL"
```

### Multi-org merge

For N source orgs merging into one SaaS `$DEST_ORG`: run Step 1 once across all exports, then repeat Steps 3–4
once per source org — set `EXPORT` to that org's export and `SRC_ORG`/`SRC_URL` to that instance each time.

Why the order is fixed (hard dependencies): a SaaS team slugged `migration` must exist before **3a**; **3b**
attaches teams to already-created projects; **3d** needs the user mappings from **3c**; **3e** maps each
alert's owner team via the mappings from **3b**. Settings (Step 4) run after the objects they configure exist.
See [`core/README.md`](core/) for the full dependency notes.

Shared code lives in [`common/`](common/) (the read-only self-hosted API client used by the settings tools).

## Dependencies

- `preflight/` — **none** (Python 3 standard library only).
- `core/` and the settings tools — `requests`:

```bash
pip install "requests>=2.31.0"
```

## Known limitations (carried, flagged for review)

- **Alert notification actions** are not preserved; migrated rules (metric and issue) get a default
  email-the-owner-team action only (issue alerts fall back to `IssueOwners` when a rule has no owner team).
- **Member roles** are flattened to `member` (integration-token invite limitation).
- **Project slugs / DSNs change** because slug isn't sent on create (SaaS derives it from the name).
- **Duplicate names across instances** must be resolved before a merged run (`preflight/duplicates_report.py`
  reports them; the tools do not auto-rename).
